# govd

a telegram bot for downloading media from various platforms

this project was born after the discontinuation of a highly popular bot known as UVD, and draws significant inspiration from [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

- official instance: [@govd_bot](https://t.me/govd_bot)
- support group: [govdsupport](https://t.me/govdsupport)

## features

- download media from various platforms
- download videos, photos, and audio
- inline mode support
- group chat support with customizable settings
- media caption support

## dependencies

- ffmpeg >= 6.1.1
- libheif >= 1.19.7
- pkg-config
- mysql db

## installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/govdbot/govd.git
cd govd
# edit .env file with your bot token and database credentials
sh build.sh
```

## installation with docker

first build the image using the dockerfile

```bash
docker build -t govd-bot .
```

next, update the .env file to ensure the database properties match the environment variables defined for the MariaDB service in the docker-compose.yml file 
(while the default environment variables defined for the MariaDB service are acceptable, it is recommended to change the `MYSQL_PASSWORD` property in the docker-compose.yaml file for enhanced security and ensure that you also modify the the `DB_PASSWORD` property in the .env file to reflect this change)

the following line in the .env file MUST be set as shown below

```env
DB_HOST=db
```

finally run the compose to start all services

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**note:**
to avoid limits on files, you should host your own telegram botapi. public bot instance is currently running under a botapi fork, [tdlight-telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/tdlight-team/tdlight-telegram-bot-api), but you can use the official botapi client too.

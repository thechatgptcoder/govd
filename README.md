# govd
a telegram bot for downloading media from various platforms

this project was born after the discontinuation of a highly popular bot known as uvd, and draws significant inspiration from [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

- official instance: [@govd_bot](https://t.me/govd_bot)
- support group: [govdsupport](https://t.me/govdsupport)

# dependencies
- ffmpeg >= 7.x **(*)**
- libheif >= 1.19.7
- pkg-config
- mysql or mariadb

**note:** libav shared libraries must be installed on the system in order to build the bot.

# installation
## build
_this method only works on linux and macos, if you want to build the bot on windows, check [docker installation](#installation-with-docker) instead._

1. clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/govdbot/govd.git && cd govd
    ```

2. edit the `.env` file to set the database properties.  
   for enhanced security, it is recommended to change the `DB_PASSWORD` property in the `.env` file.

3. make sure your database is up and running.

4. build and run the bot:

    ```bash
    sh build.sh && ./govd
    ```

## docker (recommended)
> [!WARNING]  
> this method is currently not working due to a wrong version of the libav (ffmpeg) library in the docker image. feel free to open a PR if you can fix it.

1. build the image using the dockerfile:

    ```bash
    docker build -t govd-bot .
    ```

2. update the `.env` file to ensure the database properties match the environment variables defined for the mariadb service in the `docker-compose.yml` file.  
   for enhanced security, it is recommended to change the `MYSQL_PASSWORD` property in `docker-compose.yaml` and ensure `DB_PASSWORD` in `.env` matches it.

    the following line in the `.env` file **must** be set as:

    ```
    DB_HOST=db
    ```

3. run the compose to start all services:

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

**note:** to avoid limits on files, you should host your own telegram botapi. public bot instance is currently running under a botapi fork, [tdlight-telegram-bot-api](https://github.com/tdlight-team/tdlight-telegram-bot-api), but you can use the official botapi client too.

# proxying
there are two types of proxying available: http and edge.
- **http proxy**: this is a standard http proxy that can be used to route requests through a proxy server. you can set the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables to use this feature. (SOCKS5 is supported too)
- **edge proxy**: this is a custom proxy that is used to route requests through a specific url. you can set the `EDGE_PROXY_URL` environment variable to use this feature. this is useful for routing requests through a specific server or service. howver, this feature is not totally implemented yet.

**note:** by settings `NO_PROXY` environment variable, you can specify domains that should not be proxied.

# authentication
some extractors require authentication to access the content. you can easily use cookies for that; simply export cookies from your browser in netscape format and place them in cookies folder (e.g. `cookies/reddit.txt`). you can easily export cookies using _Get cookies.txt LOCALLY_ extension for your browser.

# todo
- [ ] add more extractors
- [ ] switch to native libav
- [ ] add tests
- [ ] improve error handling
- [ ] add support for telegram webhooks
- [ ] switch to pgsql (?)
- [ ] better api (?)
- [ ] better docs with multiple readme

# setup
youtube extractor is currently based on the invidious api.

## why invidious
* avoids ip bans and rate limits from youtube
* removes the need to bypass captchas or bot protections
* allows you to use public or self-hosted invidious instances
* provides a stable, simplified api for accessing video info and streams

## configuration
you must specify the invidious instance in your `ext-cfg.yaml` file:

```yaml
youtube:
  instance: https://your-invidious-instance.example.com
```

for more details, see [configuration page](CONFIGURATION.md).

## notes
* if the invidious instance is slow, rate-limited, or offline, video extraction may fail
* choose a reliable public instance or run your own for best results
